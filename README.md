# Overview

TimeGreet is a lightweight desktop application designed to provide personalized greetings and motivational inspiration based on the user's local time. This application combines real-time awareness with an external API to deliver contextual encouragement throughout the day.

The purpose of this project is to create a tool that reminds me to take regular breaks during my workday. I plan to use customized messages that encourage me to stretch and move away from my desk, as I spend most of my time working at my computer.
